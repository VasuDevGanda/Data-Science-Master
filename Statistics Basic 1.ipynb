Descriptive statistics explains already known data related to a particular sample or population of a small size. Inferential statistics, however, aims to draw inferences or conclusions about a whole population.\n",

    "Examples of descriptive statistics are used to enumerate and explain a dataset's key characteristics. Measures like mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation are some examples. For instance, you could use descriptive statistics to determine the average age, the age distribution, and the age standard deviation of a group of individuals if you wanted to summarize their ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a sample of data, inferential statistics is used to draw conclusions or generalizations about a broader population. Examples include regression analysis, confidence ranges, and hypothesis testing. For instance, you could use inferential statistics to assess whether there is a significant difference in the outcomes of patients who receive the drug compared to those who receive a placebo if you want to know if a new drug is effective."
