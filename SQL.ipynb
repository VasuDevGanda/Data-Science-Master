    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of four commonly used DDL statements along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE**: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or procedures. It defines the structure and initial properties of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       EmployeeID INT,\n",
    "       Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP**: The DROP statement is used to remove database objects from the database. It permanently deletes the object and its associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER**: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can be used to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or other properties of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Adding a new column \"Email\" to the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD Email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE**: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. Unlike the DROP statement, TRUNCATE only removes data, not the table itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of three commonly used DML statements along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INSERT**: The INSERT statement is used to add new records or rows into a table. It allows you to specify the values to be inserted into the columns of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Inserting a new record into the \"Employees\" table with values for the \"EmployeeID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary\" columns:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 5000);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UPDATE**: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns for specific rows based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Updating the salary of an employee with the \"EmployeeID\" of 1 in the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE Employees\n",
    "   SET Salary = 6000\n",
    "   WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DELETE**: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more records from a table. It allows you to specify conditions to identify the rows to be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Deleting all employees with a salary less than 3000 from the \"Employees\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "   WHERE Salary < 3000;\n",
