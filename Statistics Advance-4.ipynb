    "**Ans:** In hypothesis testing, Type 1 and Type 2 errors are two possible errors that can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. This means that the researcher concludes that there is a significant difference or effect when there is actually none in the population. The probability of making a Type 1 error is denoted by alpha, and it is typically set at a predetermined level (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) before conducting the hypothesis test. An example scenario for Type 1 error is a drug trial where the null hypothesis is that the drug does not have any effect, and the alternative hypothesis is that the drug has an effect. If the researchers conclude that the drug has an effect, but it actually does not, then it is a Type 1 error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false. This means that the researcher fails to conclude that there is a significant difference or effect when there is actually one in the population. The probability of making a Type 2 error is denoted by beta. An example scenario for Type 2 error is a medical test where the null hypothesis is that the patient is healthy, and the alternative hypothesis is that the patient is sick. If the test results indicate that the patient is healthy, but the patient is actually sick, then it is a Type 2 error.\n",

    "In hypothesis testing, there is always a trade-off between Type 1 and Type 2 errors. Decreasing the probability of one type of error increases the probability of the other type of error.

    "**Ans:** Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or evidence. The theorem states that the probability of an event occurring given some evidence is equal to the prior probability of the event multiplied by the likelihood of the evidence given the event, divided by the probability of the evidence.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "An example scenario where Bayes's theorem can be applied is in medical diagnosis. Let's say a certain disease affects 1 in 1000 people in the general population. A diagnostic test for the disease has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 98%.
