    "1. Up-sampling (Upscaling):\n",
    "    Up-sampling involves increasing the resolution of a signal, image, or dataset. This is typically done by inserting new data points or expanding the existing ones. The purpose of up-sampling is often to increase the size or quality of the data, or to prepare it for further processing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example - Image Upscaling:\n",
    "    Suppose you have a low-resolution image, let's say a 100x100 pixel image, which appears pixelated and lacks fine details. To enhance the image quality and make it more visually appealing, you may want to up-sample it to a higher resolution, such as 400x400 pixels. One common technique for up-scaling is using interpolation, such as bilinear or bicubic interpolation, which estimates the missing pixel values based on the surrounding pixels. This process results in a smoother and more detailed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Down-sampling (Downscaling):\n",
    "    Down-sampling involves reducing the resolution of a signal, image, or dataset by removing some of the data points. The purpose of down-sampling is often to reduce the data size, simplify the data, or to prepare it for specific applications with lower resolution requirements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example - Audio Down-sampling:\n",
    "    Consider a high-quality audio recording with a sample rate of 96,000 Hz. This high sample rate captures a wide range of frequencies, including inaudible ones. However, if you want to transmit this audio over the internet or store it on a device with limited storage, you might choose to down-sample the audio to a lower sample rate, say 44,100 Hz, which is the standard for CDs. By doing so, you can reduce the file size while still maintaining a reasonable audio quality for most listeners."
